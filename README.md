# Genetic-Algorithm
It's my 1st time to write a blog and upload my code.And you can easily see that my code is not brief enough ,I'll make it better later.But i did't see many GA wirrten in Python.So I make this decision to write this blog.I guess if u want to write a GA in Pythonï¼Œthis might help a little.
This GA is written to solve TSPs.


Advantages:
It's easier for Python to read the data file than C/Java.
When you write a function,you can easily test it.
You can analyze the result by using the matplotlib.pyplot to present the diagram.
Disadvantages:
Python is too slow when you have a large amount of data.

PS:This code does't include the variation part.
